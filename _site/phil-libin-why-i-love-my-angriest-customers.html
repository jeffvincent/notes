      <h1>Phil Libin: Why I Love My Angriest Customers</h1>

      <ul>
<li>Phil has an easy-to-guess (although not public) email address</li>
<li>Feedback comes from many many sources - Facebook page, blogs, forums,
Twitter, email - everyone is swimming in feedback (even Apple).

<ul>
<li>Some of these sources are customer created - and with the Internet, it's
easy to spread and grow them.</li>
<li>You cannot stop the feedback, but you can control where it happens and help
monitor the situation (ie setting up your own forums, encouraging certain
modes of feedback)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having a not-feedback run company, then, is a function of management, and not
of feedback channels.</li>
<li>"In short: Customer feedback is great for telling you what you did wrong.
It's terrible at telling you what you should do next."</li>
<li>Three buckets for customer feedback: <em>complaints</em>, <em>suggestions</em>, and
<em>compliments</em></li>
<li>"The Internet is the most efficient invention in the history of the universe
for concentrating dissatisfaction into its purest, darkest, and most bilious
essence"</li>
<li>Story about launch video for Evernote, and comment was "voice over person
should be found and beaten to death".

<ul>
<li>"Even in that comment, there was an element of truth"</li>
<li>Phil suggests NOT rushing to fix things, but instead take a more measured
approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"People have a great sense of what's making them unhappy right now, but
they're not very good at predicting what will make them happy in the future."</li>
<li>Compliments should be shared with the team.</li>
</ul>
