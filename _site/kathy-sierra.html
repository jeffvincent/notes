      <ul>
<li>everyone starts out thinking they must create the most desirable product
(more desirable than the competition)</li>
<li>There is not an engagement problem - no one wishes they could engage more
with brands. No one.</li>
<li><strong>Gamification</strong> has a tiny little sliver of use cases where it's valuable,
and a whole lot of places where it is harmful.</li>
<li>What we call "loyalty" is just bribery and incentivizing. Not loyalty (still
awesome).</li>
<li>So how do we remain desirable, without needing to bribe or incentivize?</li>
<li>Nope, it's not quality - there are products that are great quality, didn't
sell (<code>GP; DS</code>)</li>
<li>So what drives desireability? What drives one user to recommend an app to
someone else?</li>
<li>Word of Mouth value just keeps going up (% who trust WOM above all else up
20% since 2007)</li>
<li>WOM drives sustained desirability - so what drives WOM?</li>
<li>Key attributes for building an app that drives WOM and makes people feel awesome?
Not in the app! They are in the user.</li>
<li>Make the user <strong>successful</strong>, and the user needs to get results.</li>
<li>It's not about <em>marketing</em>, it's not about <em>quality</em>, it's about <em>user awesome</em></li>
<li>It's not about what the user <em>thinks of you</em>, it's about what the <em>user can do</em></li>
<li>People aren't using your app because the like the app or they like you, they
are using the app because they like <strong>themselves</strong>.</li>
<li>Similarly, people tell their friends because they like their friends!</li>
</ul>


<h2>CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>

<ul>
<li>The user would rather be badass than treated like a <em>puppy</em></li>
<li>customer service is supposed to <strong>enable</strong> badass users!</li>
<li>what does the user do <em>with</em> you or <em>because</em> of you? What bigger things do
you enable?</li>
<li>No one's goal is to be awesome at your app!</li>
<li>What makes someone able to concentrate on the larger thing? First, not seeing
your app in front of them. Forgetting about your app. For this, they need
expertise.</li>
<li>Expertise, in turn, is defined as repeatedly superior performance. How do
they get to this point? Getting high quality experience - which we can enable
with good training/onboarding materials.</li>
<li>IT IS NOT RAW TALENT!</li>
</ul>


<h2>MARKETING</h2>

<ul>
<li>You are a subset of something larger (i.e. marketing, video marketing)</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Killer at Final Cut Pro vs. Killer at Making Awesome Videos</li>
<li>How we treat customers - before (glossy, colorful, wonderful) &amp; after (gross,
b&amp;w, dull)</li>
<li>The marketing is focused on "the larger thing", post-buy "we lose our minds"
and concentrate on our product. Not "the thing".</li>
<li>Forget "how can we get more likes on our blog", think "how can my user get
more likes on their blog?"</li>
</ul>


<h2>PRODUCT</h2>

<ul>
<li>What would you do differently if your success depended on their results?</li>
<li>How do we enable new or more intelligent conversations as a result of what we
offer?</li>
<li><p>What do they see, have, post, say, share, because they just used your product</p></li>
<li><p>Define badass for your "thing"</p></li>
<li>"Given <strong><strong>, an expert would </strong></strong>_ (how they would outperform)"</li>
<li>Post definition, provide your users repeated exposure to the performance of
badass users.</li>
</ul>
