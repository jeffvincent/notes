<ul>
<li>All started in 2011 when Larry Page became CEO, mandated that all major apps would be re-designed...by that summer.</li>
<li>Googlers seem to think it is commonplace to carry multiple phones (ie Android and iOS). Seems to me if they preferred Android, they wouldn't carry an iOS device :)</li>
<li>Previous approach was called <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/12/2863672/google-kanna-and-strawman-redesign">Kanna</a></li>
<li>Pockets of design-thinking previously, which was always subservient to speed. It really required Larry to top-down mandate design-thinking to break this mold.</li>
<li>"Design is not just about making things more useful, it's not just about making things more beautiful, but it's about <strong>what is the right thing to make, and how to make it right</strong>." -- Matias Duarte, <em>Director of User Experience, Android</em></li>
<li>Vision was, Google could be better than instant - it could be almost psychic, and that was very provocative.</li>
<li>Design is iteration, and only after you've tried everything, can you identify what you haven't tried (and do that ).</li>
<li>A few years ago, there was no universal design language for approaching different platforms - they have worked actively on this.</li>
<li><strong>Design Process</strong>:lots of mock-ups and reviews and throwing stuff out</li>
