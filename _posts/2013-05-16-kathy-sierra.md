* everyone starts out thinking they must create the most desirable product
  (more desirable than the competition)
* There is not an engagement problem - no one wishes they could engage more
  with brands. No one.
* **Gamification** has a tiny little sliver of use cases where it's valuable,
  and a whole lot of places where it is harmful.
* What we call "loyalty" is just bribery and incentivizing. Not loyalty (still
  awesome).
* So how do we remain desirable, without needing to bribe or incentivize?
* Nope, it's not quality - there are products that are great quality, didn't
  sell (`GP; DS`)
* So what drives desireability? What drives one user to recommend an app to
  someone else?
* Word of Mouth value just keeps going up (% who trust WOM above all else up 
  20% since 2007)
* WOM drives sustained desirability - so what drives WOM?
* Key attributes for building an app that drives WOM and makes people feel awesome? 
  Not in the app! They are in the user.
* Make the user **successful**, and the user needs to get results.
* It's not about *marketing*, it's not about *quality*, it's about *user awesome*
* It's not about what the user *thinks of you*, it's about what the *user can do*
* People aren't using your app because the like the app or they like you, they
  are using the app because they like **themselves**.
* Similarly, people tell their friends because they like their friends!

## CUSTOMER SERVICE

* The user would rather be badass than treated like a *puppy*
* customer service is supposed to **enable** badass users!
* what does the user do *with* you or *because* of you? What bigger things do
  you enable?
* No one's goal is to be awesome at your app!
* What makes someone able to concentrate on the larger thing? First, not seeing
  your app in front of them. Forgetting about your app. For this, they need
  expertise.
* Expertise, in turn, is defined as repeatedly superior performance. How do
  they get to this point? Getting high quality experience - which we can enable
  with good training/onboarding materials.
* IT IS NOT RAW TALENT!

## MARKETING

* You are a subset of something larger (i.e. marketing, video marketing)
* **Example:** Killer at Final Cut Pro vs. Killer at Making Awesome Videos
* How we treat customers - before (glossy, colorful, wonderful) & after (gross,
  b&w, dull)
* The marketing is focused on "the larger thing", post-buy "we lose our minds"
  and concentrate on our product. Not "the thing".
* Forget "how can we get more likes on our blog", think "how can my user get
  more likes on their blog?"

## PRODUCT

* What would you do differently if your success depended on their results?
* How do we enable new or more intelligent conversations as a result of what we
  offer?
* What do they see, have, post, say, share, because they just used your product

* Define badass for your "thing"
* "Given ____, an expert would _____ (how they would outperform)"
* Post definition, provide your users repeated exposure to the performance of
  badass users.
