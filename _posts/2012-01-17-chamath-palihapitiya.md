### 3 Biggest Questions facing applications for growth ###

  1. How do you get people in the front door?
  2. How do you get them to an 'a-ha' moment as quickly as possible?
  3. How do you deliver core product value as often as possible?


### Question ###

What is the core value of the product? How is that exposed to users, and when?

### Quotes and Other Things ###

* "Measure some shit, Try some shit, Test some more shit, throw the shit that 
doesn't work out...it's just not that complicated!"
* "Growth is a very simple understanding of product value and consumer behavior"
* "Two different choices - you can do what you think is *right*, independent of 
what the external feedback loop tells you, and choice number two is to do what
you read about and what you get credit for and what people tell you is interesting.
This second class of things ... destroys products"
* "Complexity, when communicated simply, can be extremely useful."

* Biggest risk is alienating current customers. It doesn't always show up 
immediately, but it does over time, and once it does, you can't get them back.

* Only once those big three problems are resolved can you *begin* thinking of virality.

* Disprove all of the **lore** that is floating around. When someone throws out 
gut feeling and assumptions, test it. You must be emotionally detached and just 
figure out what is happening and why.

* Everything around how the company is built and structured goes back to the core
product mission and value of the company.

* When you see a user spiral downward, it's not a growth problem (although numerically
it is a growth problem) - it's a core value and a culture problem.

### RECRUITING ###
* "Detached, egoless, not living the hype, not trying to follow some lifestyle,
but doing what you think is important, focusing on core value, ruthlessly prioritizing,
and getting more people who believe in those things"
* High IQ, High sense of purpose, relentless focus on real success, respectable 
competitiveness, very high quality bar that borders on perfection, people who are 
comfortable tearing down what works (courage), high integrity (long-term thinking),
rewarding the culture and set of values"
