* All started in 2011 when Larry Page became CEO, mandated that all major apps would be re-designed...by that summer.
* Googlers seem to think it is commonplace to carry multiple phones (ie Android and iOS). Seems to me if they preferred Android, they wouldn't carry an iOS device :)
* Previous approach was called [Kanna](http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/12/2863672/google-kanna-and-strawman-redesign)
* Pockets of design-thinking previously, which was always subservient to speed. It really required Larry to top-down mandate design-thinking to break this mold.
* "Design is not just about making things more useful, it's not just about making things more beautiful, but it's about **what is the right thing to make, and how to make it right**." -- Matias Duarte, *Director of User Experience, Android*
* Vision was, Google could be better than instant - it could be almost psychic, and that was very provocative.
* Design is iteration, and only after you've tried everything, can you identify what you haven't tried (and do that ).
* A few years ago, there was no universal design language for approaching different platforms - they have worked actively on this.
* **Design Process**:lots of mock-ups and reviews and throwing stuff out
