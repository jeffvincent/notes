## Principles of Accelerated Learning

* Unlock prior knowledge
  * A lot of what is about to be taught is already known.
  * What does the learner already know, what would be good for them to know?
* Share a strong sense of purpose
  * Content - "this is what we'll learn"
  * Process - "here's how we'll learn it"
  * Benefit - "Here's why we're learning it"
* Actively Engage
  * Put your hands up in the air!
  * Encourage them to ask really great questions
  * Collaborate
* Space deliberate practice "Don't binge learn"
  * Rehearse, then revisit
  * Fail, then fail better
  * "Getting stuck isn't a problem, staying stuck is"
  * Good learners practice getting unstuck, and here's how (in the Wistia
    context, it would be the docs, support emails, videos, etc.)
* Loop meaningful feedback
  * Iterative feedback often (NOT JUST AT THE END!)
* Encourage deep questions & Pattern Recognition
  * This is what we're really good at as humans!
* Provide real-world transfer as much as possible
  * Make sure they are trialing it and testing it!

* Connect - with what is already known
* Activate - Encourage engagement and deep questioning, give them problems to
  solve
* Demonstrate - Let them attempt to solve problems against real-world issues.
* Consolidate - wrap it up, repeat it again, give them the next-level questions

**What have we learned, how have we learned it, how will we use it?**

*In times of change the learners will inherit the Earth, whilst the knowers
will be beautifully prepared for a world which no longer exists..."*
