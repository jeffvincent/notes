- Phil has an easy-to-guess (although not public) email address
- Feedback comes from many many sources - Facebook page, blogs, forums,
  Twitter, email - everyone is swimming in feedback (even Apple).
  - Some of these sources are customer created - and with the Internet, it's
    easy to spread and grow them.
  - You cannot stop the feedback, but you can control where it happens and help
    monitor the situation (ie setting up your own forums, encouraging certain
    modes of feedback)
- Having a not-feedback run company, then, is a function of management, and not
  of feedback channels.
- "In short: Customer feedback is great for telling you what you did wrong.
  It's terrible at telling you what you should do next."
- Three buckets for customer feedback: *complaints*, *suggestions*, and
  *compliments*
- "The Internet is the most efficient invention in the history of the universe
  for concentrating dissatisfaction into its purest, darkest, and most bilious
  essence"
- Story about launch video for Evernote, and comment was "voice over person
  should be found and beaten to death".
  - "Even in that comment, there was an element of truth"
  - Phil suggests NOT rushing to fix things, but instead take a more measured
    approach
- "People have a great sense of what's making them unhappy right now, but
  they're not very good at predicting what will make them happy in the future."
- Compliments should be shared with the team.
